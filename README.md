# Overview
Here is the collection of projects I wrote for my upper division CS165A - Artificial
Intelligence and CS165B Machine Learning classes I took at UCSB. Projects are
implemented in Python 3 from scratch and demonstrate my understanding of core concepts
and algorithms in AI and ML. Each project has a separate directory with its own README.

# Projects
