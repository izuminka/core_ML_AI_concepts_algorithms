# Organization
Here is the collection of projects I wrote for my upper division CS165A - Artificial
Intelligence and CS165B Machine Learning classes I took at UCSB. Projects are
implemented in Python from scratch and demonstrate my understanding of core concepts
and algorithms in AI and ML.

### Projects list (all are implemented in Python 3)
- **[Naive Bayes Classifier](https://github.com/izuminka/core_ML_AI_concepts_algorithms/tree/master/Naive_Bayes_Classifier)**
- **Trees: C4.5 and Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression with SGD**

### Uploading soon
- **HEX Bot Player (minimax with alpha-beta pruning)**
- **Perception**
- **Multiplayer perception**
